In this practical, application of LabVIEW  software in data acquisition and data manipulation was studied. Theoretical and practical knowledge needed in using LabVIEW in data acquisition through the DAQ card were acquired through this practical. Also the theoretical knowledge and practical
limitations of digital data acquisition systems were practically understood. So, all in all, it can be concluded
that through this practical, all the basic knowledge needed in the use of LabVIEW combined with a DAQ card in any needed application was achieved practically.

# Hardware-interfacing-using-Labview
Examples of using Labview for hardware interfacing 

The purpose of this report is to eectively use the LabVIEW software in data acquisition and data
manipulation. Data acquisition and data manipulation are very important aspects of many modern
systems including scientic applications. The rst part of the practical is based on basic operations
in LabVIEW to get familiar with the GUI and the tools of the LabVIEW. The second part of
the practical include applying the learnt techniques in signal generation, signal analysis and data
acquisition and processing. In signal generation, a signal generator capable of producing sinusoidal,
triangular, rectangular and saw tooth signals was created. In signal analysis, an oscilloscope was
created. In data acquisition and processing, a resistance meter, a capacitance meter and a diode
curve generating tool were created.
